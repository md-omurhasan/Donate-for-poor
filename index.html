                            sky. In extreme winter, they sometimes freeze to death in certain areas. In rural areas,
                            they live in mud thatched small huts and in urban areas in ghettos (slums), devoid of all
                            basic utilities—water, latrines, bathrooms, electricity, etc. Thus, such persons must be
                            defined as poor, no matter whether society recognizes their poverty or not.</p>

                            Most poor people are either engaged in low-paying jobs or are without jobs. Some are too ill
                            or disabled to work and others are living alone (aged, widowed), who cannot earn enough to
                            support themselves and their children, if any. The poor cannot get loans for
                            self-employment.
